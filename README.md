This article was pretty interesting. They figured out what China censors on TV by watching "The Big Bang Theory" and finding the bits and pieces of scenes that were different from the original. I don't quite know how to explain the way they plotted this data. It was cool, but pretty scattered and unorganized. I didn't know what it was at first. Basically they found that "77 of the first 100 episodes had at least one edit, amounting to 206 removed scenes" They categorized the scenes that eluded to sex, LGBTQ+, and disrespect toward China. Each of these categories were color coded on this plot. By the end of the article, it all went into one bar at the top of the plot. It could be more organized and it was just kind of hard to visualize the data with this approach.

This article was about women making headlines and how the words in headlines are about women. The data was arranged in a simple manner. Arranged by country and ordered by frequency. I liked the way they had this set up, it was easy to read and simple to follow along. I think they could have added a couple more countries to the chart and could have been more specific with the data.

This article was showing data on the polls and figuring out if the polls will "overestimate democrats again". I honestly wasn't a huge fan of how this data was represented. I didn't quite understand how to read it. It was good in their chart that they had a list of the years to compare and contrast the polls in previous years to. I'm sure it makes sense to someone who understands how to read this data, but if you don't, you might be looking at it for a little bit longer. I think if they explained it better, it would make more sense.
